# reactjs-gettingstarted
Its all about Reactjs, a basic introduction for beginners to start using reactjs

####This markdown will give pretty good understanding of react-js and implementing uni-directional flow using FLUX architecture.

## Reactjs: 
* Facebook called Rethink established best practices.
* JSX combines HTML and JS. an awesome innovation.
* Virtual DOM, dont use the real DOM and diffing algorithm will take care of rendering the changed components instead of all the components. differnt from Two way databinding.

## Let's Talk Tech: Core Technologies we used in this course
* Reactjs - just a view layer in MVC.
* Node.js - server side javascript.
* React-Router: Routing in the frontend routes.
* Flux- uni-directional data flows. (More a pattern and then a library)
* Webpack- bundles up all your js and on the fly create a dev server and useful in build process, hot reload and many more.

## Why Virtual DOM ??
* Updating the DOM is expensive.
* Update the components which needs to be changed with the help of diffing algorithm.
* Use `shouldComponentUpdate` may be useful when you don't your component to be updated on a change.
* Synthetic Events
* Isomorphic support
* React Native - to render on native applications
